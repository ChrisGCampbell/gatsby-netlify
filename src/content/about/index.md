Hello! I'm Chris, a process / management consultant based in Atlanta, GA who enjoys managing and executing projects. Detail-oriented and self-motivated IT & Operations focused project manager with advanced education in both business and computer science.

Shortly after graduating from [Nevada State](https://www.nsc.edu/) I worked on several projects for companies such as AT&T and MARI Research Institute. I later enrolled in [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/)'s graduate computing systems program.
