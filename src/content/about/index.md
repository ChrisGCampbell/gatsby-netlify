Hello! I'm Chris, a software engineer based in Atlanta, GA who enjoys building things that live on the internet. I develop exceptional websites and web apps that provide intuitive, pixel-perfect user interfaces with efficient and modern backends.

Shortly after graduating from [Nevada State](https://www.nsc.edu/) I worked on several backend applications for companies such as AT&T and MARI Research Institute. I later enrolled in [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/)'s graduate computing systems program. I also currently work for their police department working on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.

I was recently awarded the IBM community badge for [Node.js](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/b057e606-2624-4cca-9f09-bad6d9c9b444/public_url)
